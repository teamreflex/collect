# Giga Stack âœ¨

Inspired by [T3 stack](https://create.t3.gg/) and [Shadcn Taxonomy](https://tx.shadcn.com/) project, I created this example of experimental edge stack full of sweet and fancy features for you to play with. Shout out to a bunch of open source solutions on the GitHub which I combined here.

[deployed demo](https://giga-stack.vercel.app/)

## Features

- ``Next.js`` 13 app dir (edge runtime)
- ``tRPC``
- ``Clerk`` Auth
- ``Drizzle`` ORM + ``PlanetScale`` serverless js driver
- ``Shadcn/ui`` (Radix UI + Tailwind)


## Try it yourself

Install dependencies using pnpm:
```bash
pnpm install
```

Copy .env.example to .env and update the variables:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Push schema to PlanetScale:
```bash
pnpm db:push
```

Have fun
```bash
pnpm dev
```
